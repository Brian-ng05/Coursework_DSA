# Online Bookstore CLI Application

This Java mini project simulates an online bookstore with a command-line interface (CLI), designed to practice **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** principles and working with **DSA**. It includes core functionalities such as browsing books, placing and processing orders in a queue, as well as searching and sorting orders directly from the terminal.
## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This mini project was developed as part of a coursework assignment with the goal of practicing:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation, modular design)  
- **Data structures** such as `ArrayList` (for managing books) and `Queue` (for handling orders)  
- **Algorithms** including `Insertion Sort` (for sorting orders/books) and `Binary Search` (for efficient searching) 
- **Console-based interaction** via a simple text-based menu system  
- **Problem-solving and software design** through implementing real-world bookstore operations  
## âœ¨ Features

- **Book Management**: Add, view, and search books in the bookstore library.  
- **Order Placement**: Customers can place orders which are stored in a queue (FIFO).  
- **Order Processing**: Process orders sequentially, simulating real-world order handling.  
- **Efficient Searching**: Use `Binary Search` to quickly locate orders or books.  
- **Sorting**: Apply `Insertion Sort` to organize orders for better management.  
- **CLI Menu Interface**: Simple text-based menu for easy user interaction. 

## ðŸ“¸ Demo

The following screenshots illustrate the workflow of the Online Bookstore CLI application:

| Step | Screenshot | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | ![Main Menu](src/images/menu.png) | Main menu displayed when the program starts, and the action when creating a new order |
| 2 | ![View Books](src/images/all_book.png) | View all available books in the bookstore |
| 3 | ![Choose Book 1](src/images/chose_book1.png) | Select a book to place an order |
| 4 | ![Choose Book 2](src/images/chose_book2.png) | Select one more book to place an order | 
| 6 | ![Complete Order](src/images/complete_order.png) | Finish the order after chosing the books |
| 5 | ![View Orders](src/images/view_all_order.png) | Display all orders currently stored in the queue |
